\label{subsec_method_datasources}

\emph{Match Forrest, Match!} is build on four different data source.

The first data source is \textit{IMDB}\footnote{\url{http://www.imdb.com/}}.
This data source consists of more than 274,000 movies and more than 365,000 people.
This data source is \textit{the} internet webpage for movies.
To get the individual movie resources, our system has to crawl HTML pages.

Another big movie platform is \textit{freebase}\footnote{\url{http://www.freebase.com/}}.
Freebase is a connected user-generated open database, which contains a lot of links to other platforms.
It has more than 250,000 movies and more than 430,000 people.
Freebase offers a MQL API and a Topic API, which can be queried to get movie resources.

\textit{themoviedb.org}\footnote{\url{http://www.themoviedb.org/}} (TMDB) is a movie database, which contains a lot of images.
It offers also an API to send requests for movie resources.
TMDB is a collection of more than 171,000 movies and 605,000 people.
TMDB also published diffs, which is helpful to keep all movies from this data source up-to-date.

The last data source is \textit{OFDB}\footnote{\url{http://www.ofdb.de/}}.
This data source is specialised on German movies.
It contains more than 236,000 movies and 54,000 people.
\\ \\
To create an unified dataset of movies, a main data source must be choosen, to match movies from different data source against the main data source.
For \emph{Match Forrest, Match!} \textit{IMDB} was choosen to be the main data source.
\textit{IMDB} is the data source with the most movies and people.
Additionally, \textit{IMDB} is maintained by data editors, which manually add, delete and update the data\footnote{\url{https://uk-amazon.icims.com/jobs/274286/data-editor\%2c-database-content/job}}.

All the other data sources are not that well maintained or are not as big as \textit{IMDB}.
\\ \\
Helpful for matching movies from \textit{freebase}, \textit{TMDB} and \textit{OFDB} to IMDB is, that all three data source have already some links to \textit{IMDB}.
