\subsection{Architecture}
\label{subsec_method_architecture}

The architecture of \emph{Match Forrest, Match!} is shown in Figure \ref{fig_architecture}.
\\ \\
The central component of the system is the \textit{Task Distributor}.
This component is responsible for managing the other components, \textit{Crawler}, \textit{Triplifier}, \textit{Updater} and \textit{Matcher and Merger}.
The details of this messaging systems are explained in Section \ref{subsubsec_messaging_infrastructure}.
\\ \\
In general, the first step to get a movie into the system is to get the acutal movie resource.
This step is executed by the \textit{Crawler.}
This component is responsible for downloading websites and for sending requests to the provided API from a data source.

Once the page is downloaded, the \textit{Triplifier} can triplify the resource.
This means it extracting the information from the resource and creating triples out of it.
Therefore the ontology, defined in Section \ref{subsec_method_ontology}, is used.

The component \textit{Matcher and Merger} is in charge of matching two movies from different data sources, so they only can be found once in the resulting dataset.
This component is explained in detail in Section \ref{subsec_method_matching}.

The updater, described in Section \ref{subsec_method_updating}, ensures that the movies are always up to date.
\\ \\
The triplestore \textit{Virtuoso} is used to store the resulting triples.
To distinguish between the sources of the different triples, triples from each data source are stored in the graph named after the source.
Thus, there are four graphs in the triplestore, \textit{IMDb}, \textit{Freebase}, \textit{TMDb} and \textit{OFDb}.
