\subsection{Matching}
\label{subsec_method_matching}

The following sections show the approach for matching (i.e. finding the same entity in different datasets) and merging (i.e. integrating two different datasets about the same entity into one.)

\subsubsection{Problem statement}
After loading the initial dataset into the database, the task is to integrate another dataset to finally create the whole dataset with more information than one single dataset can provide.

But simply dumping the second dataset into the database would lead to duplicate entries with slighly different names, thereby decreasing the overall database quality.

However, only using the name as a matching criteria TODO
Because of the following problems: TODO
\begin{itemize}
	\item TODO Take things from poster.
	\item TODO Take things from poster.
	\item TODO Take things from poster.
\end{itemize}
This is way a more sophisticated approach needs to be developed.

\subsubsection{Matching using Actor overlap}
In general, the matching algorithm must satisfy two requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{High precision}: We need a high precision.
	\item{Performance:} It must run fast enough to TODO
\end{enumerate}

General idea: actor overlap
