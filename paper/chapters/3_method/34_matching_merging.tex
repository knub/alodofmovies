\subsection{Matching}
\label{subsec_method_matching}

The following sections show the approach for matching (i.e. finding the same entity in different datasets) and merging (i.e. integrating two different datasets about the same entity into one.)

\subsubsection{Problem statement}
After loading the initial dataset into the database, the task is to integrate another dataset to finally create a whole dataset with more information than a single one can provide on their own.

However, simply dumping the second dataset into the database would lead to duplicated entries and thereby decreasing the overall quality of the database.
Thus, the datasets need to be aggregated and unified.
Matching movies, actors, ... but now focus on movies. TODO

A first approach is to match movies by their name.
However, only using the name as a matching criteria yields multiple problems, such as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item different movies having the same name e.g.
	\begin{itemize} 
        \item The Avengers (2012) vs. The Avengers (1998)
    \end{itemize}
	\item same movies having different names in different datasets e.g.
	\begin{itemize} 
        \item typos: Batman vs Badman
        \item localization: The Internship vs. Prakti.com
        \item formating: The Italian Job vs. Italian Job, The
     \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Hence, a more sophisticated approach needs to be developed to increase the quality of the dataset.

\subsubsection{Matching using Actor overlap}
In general, the matching algorithm must satisfy two requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{High precision}: A movies should not be matched to a wrong movie.
	\item{Performance:} Matching should not take to long TODO
\end{enumerate}
