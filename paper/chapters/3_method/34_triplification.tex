\subsection{Triplification of Movie Resources}
\label{subsec_method_triplification}

Triplification is the step of converting information from a movie resource into triples.
The triples are created according to the ontology, defined in Section~\ref{subsec_method_ontology}.

To create triples from the raw file of the movie resource, the information in the file has to be mapped to a corresponding predicate.
For example, the title of the movie ``Forrest Gump'', displayed on a website, has to be converted into the triple
\begin{center}\emph{<http://movie/Forrest\_Gump> dbpprop:title ``Forrest Gump''}.\end{center}
To guarantee this, every data source was analyzed and parsed manually.
In this way, it is strictly defined, which part of a movie resource contains valuable information and which RDF predicate corresponds to the type of information.
