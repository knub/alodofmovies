\subsection{Triplification of Movie Resources}
\label{subsec_method_triplification}

Triplification is the step of converting information from a movie resource into triples.
The ontology, defined in Section \ref{subsec_method_ontology}, is used to generate the triples.

To create triples from the information of a movie resource, the information has to be matched to a corresponding predicate.
For example, the title of the movie "Forrest Gump", displayed on a website, has to be converted into the triple
\begin{center}\emph{<http://movie/Forrest\_Gump> dbpprop:title "Forrest Gump"}.\end{center}
To guarantee this, every data source was analyzed and parsed manually.
So, it is strictly defined which part of a movie resource contains valuable information and which RDF predicate corresponds to the type of information.
