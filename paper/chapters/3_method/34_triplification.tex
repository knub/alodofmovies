\subsection{Triplification}
\label{subsec_method_triplification}

Triplification is the step of converting information from a movie resource into triple.
To generate the triple, the ontology, defined in Section \ref{subsec_method_ontology}, is used.

To create the triples from the information of a movie resource, the information has to be matched to a corresponding triple.
For example, the title of the movie "Forrest Gump" displyed on a website has to be converted into the triple \emph{<http://movie> dbpprop:title "Forrest Gump"}.
To garuantee this, every data source was analyzed and parsed manually.
So, it is strictly defined which part of a movie resource contains valuable information and in what kind of triple this information should be converted.
