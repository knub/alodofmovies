\subsection{Matching}
\label{subsec_evaluation_matching}

\subsubsection{Introduction}
The matching algorithm, explained in \ref{subsec_method_matching}, depends on multiple parameters. The following paragraphs explain the process of tuning these parameters and evaluating the quality of the matching algorithm.

Evaluation is done on a set of 4000 randomly selected movies. The selection is done by listing all movies by name and then using $scala.util.Random$ to shuffle the list and take the first 4000 movies. To get a gold standard we only try to match those movies with an annotated IMDb-Id (but not using the Id to match the movie) and only the movies that could potentially be matched, i.e movies that are in our existing database. The result is a list of 2028 movies that could possibly be matched and are annotated with a gold standard.

Given the set of new movies N, the set of existing movies M, a found match for a new movie $f_{n_{i}}$ and a correct match $c_{n_{i}}$ where $n_{i} \in N and f_{n_{i}} \in M$. Using the algorithm explained in \ref{subsec_method_matching} the following three subsets are computed:

\begin{description}
\item[TP]: the correctly matched movies,
\begin{math}
TP \coloneqq \forall n_{i} \in N ~\exists f_{n_{i}}: f_{n_{i}} = c_{n_{i}}
\end{math}
\item[I]: the incorrectly matched movies,
\begin{math}
TP \coloneqq \forall n_{i} \in N ~\exists f_{n_{i}}: f_{n_{i}} \neq c_{n_{i}}
\end{math}
\item[N]: the not matched movies.
\begin{math}
TP \coloneqq \forall n_{i} \in N ~\nexists f_{n_{i}}
\end{math}
\end{description}

Based on these the evaluation measures are defined as follows:

\begin{description}
\item[Precision (P)] is the percentage of movies that are correctly matched from the movies that are matched.
\begin{equation}
\frac
{\left\lvert TP \right\rvert}
{\left\lvert TP \right\rvert + \left\lvert I \right\rvert}
\end{equation}
\item[Recall (R)] is the percentage of movies that are correctly matched from all possible correct matches.
\begin{equation}
\frac
{\left\lvert TP \right\rvert}
{\left\lvert TP \right\rvert + \left\lvert I \right\rvert + \left\lvert N \right\rvert}
\end{equation}
\end{description}

Based on Recall and Precision the F-measure is calculated. Since, as explained in Section \ref{subsec_method_matching}, Precision is more important the F0.5-measure is observed in the evaluation process.
