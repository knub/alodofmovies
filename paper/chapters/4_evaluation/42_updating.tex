\subsection{Updating}
\label{subsec_evaluation_updating}

The scheduler, described in Chapter \ref{subsec_method_updating}, updates movies at certain times.
Thereby, the scheduler distinguish between existing and coming soon movies.

How many coming soon movies are daily added to IMDb is shown in Figure \ref{fig_coming_soon_movie}.
On a daily basis, the coming soon page from IMDb was crawled and the changes were recorded.
Almost every day, new movies are added or deleted from the IMDb coming soon list.
It is noticeable, that the most movies are published between Thursdays to Sundays on IMDb.

In Figure \ref{fig_new_movie} the number of changed triples of a new released movie from IMDb is displayed.
Therefor, the movie was crawled and triplified daily.
As you can seen, the movie frequently changes in the first days.
Often changing triples are for example cast triple, links to images and videos, IMDb rating, charachter triples or taglines.
