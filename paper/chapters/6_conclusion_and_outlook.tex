\section{Conclusion and Outlook}
\label{sec_conclusion}

\emph{Match Forrest, Match!} is a system which combines various pieces of information from different data sources to a unified, linked open data set of movies.
The system is based on the main data source IMDb, which has extensive information on movies.
The information from this data source was enriched with data from other data sources.
Consistency and correctness of the matched data were the main focus when optimizing the matching algorithm.

In the future, the system could include more data sources.
For example a data source which contains Indian movies would be useful to expand the number and range of movies.
Also, the system should be connected to DBpedia in the future as DBpedia is the core of the semantic web.

Besides, the system could also include more resources than only feature films, such as TV films or TV series.

Furthermore, it would be helpful for users who want to search for movies, only knowing some plot points, to build a website which allows simple searching.

To ensure that movies from different data sources are matched correctly, the matching algorithm could be improved further.
Also, the merging of movies could be enhanced.
