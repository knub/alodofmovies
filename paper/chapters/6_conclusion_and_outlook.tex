\section{Conclusion and Outlook}
\label{sec_conclusion}

\emph{Match Forrest, Match!} is a system which combines various pieces of information from different data sources to a unified, linked open data set of movies.
The system is based on the four different online movie databases, IMDb, TMDb, OFDb and Freebase.
The paper detailed the resulting movie ontology and the system architecture.
Because a movie can exists in more than one of these data sources, a matching algorithm was developed and presented in this paper.
So, a movie appears only once in the resulting data set.
The developed matching algorithm uses the actor overlap and different parameter, like ...
In this paper the algorithm was evalutated an discussed.
The results showed that the algorithm yield to the best results when using the parameter values ....
Overall, the algorithm has a high percision, while still maintains a good recall.
Consistency and correctness of the matched data were the main focus when optimizing the matching algorithm.
Furthermore, a strategy to keep the resulting data set up-to-date was explained in this paper.
The movies are diveded into different categories depending on their age (time passed since they were published) and update to different frequency, because the older a movie get, the less the movie change.

In the future, the system could include more online movie databases.
For example a data source which contains Indian movies would be useful to expand the number and range of movies.
Also, the system should be connected to DBpedia in the future as DBpedia is the core of the semantic web.

Besides, the system could also include more resources than only feature movies, such as TV films or TV series.

Furthermore, it would be helpful for users who want to search for movies, only knowing some plot points, to build a website or an application which allows simple searching.

To ensure that movies from different data sources are matched correctly, the matching algorithm could be improved further.
Also, the merging of movies could be enhanced.
