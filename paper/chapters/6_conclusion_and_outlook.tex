\section{Conclusion and Outlook}
\label{sec_conclusion}

\emph{Match Forrest, Match!} is a system which combines various information from different data sources to a unified, linked open data set of movies.
The system is based on the main data source \textit{IMDb}, which has extensive information of movies.
The information from this data source were enriched which data from other data sources.
By it, highly attention was payed to the consistency and correctness of the matched data.

In the future the system could include more data sources.
For example a data source, which contains Indian movies, would be useful to expand the number and range of movies.
Also, the system should be connected to \textit{DBpedia} in the future, because \textit{DBpedia} is the core of the semantic web.

Besides, the system could also include other resources as movies, such as TV films or TV series.

Further more, it would be helpful for users, which want to search for movies only knowing some plot points, to build a website which allows easy searching.

To ensure that movies from different data sources are matched correctly, the matching algorithm could be improved further.
Also, the merging of movies could be enhanced.
